# Malicious-URL-Detection-using-Quantum-Computing

Our project "Malicious URL Detection using Quantum Computing" revolutionizes cybersecurity by utilizing quantum computing to identify malicious URLs, surpassing the constraints of conventional techniques.
Conventional systems generally depend on binary logic and static blacklists, making them reactive and susceptible to evolving, complex threats. Our project takes advantage of the special features of qubits and
quantum superposition to analyze multiple URL properties simultaneously, enabling quick and advanced pattern recognition that can adjust in real time to identify new threats. 
This multilayered approach uniquely enables realtime scanning and adaptive learning, allowing the system to evolve with emerging threat patterns.

One unique aspect of this project is the implementation of quantum-layered analysis, which offers a versatile method for detecting URL threats. Every quantum layer focuses on evaluating particular behavioral
characteristics, establishing a more intricate and flexible threat evaluation system. This method improves threat detection speed and accuracy while also making scalable cybersecurity practical and accessible to many users.
